# TechTreeify
Turn a JSON-Tech Tree into a nicely visualized one, or write a completely new one with the interface. (Created with Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game in mind).

It's fully clientside, so don't forget to click export when youre done! Server-side persistence of data (read: TechTree database) coming soon!
